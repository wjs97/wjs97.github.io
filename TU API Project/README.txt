### This was part of a project I worked on during an internship at a software consulting firm. Our client was a large construction company which used Trackunit sensors on many of its vehicles. The client wanted a system which would allow them to pull the data generated by their vehicles sensors into an interface which would allow them to easily visual the data and generate reports. To accomplish this, I leveraged Javascript in conjuction with Google Data Studio. Data Studio is an enterprise data visualization that allows users to easily glean insights from large datasets. Data Studio provides a framework, called a Community Connector, that developers can follow to fetch data from 3rd party APIs and wrangle it into Data Studio format. I implemented a custom community connector from scratch which our clients can leverage to query data from TU's classic REST APIs. To accomplish this I implemented a GUI which prompts users to provide the necessary query parameters (i.e. API key),  parsed through nested JSON objects and created a dynamic schema based on the users chosen TU database.

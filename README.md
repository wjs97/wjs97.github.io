William James Sayre's Portoflio

I'm a graduate student studying for my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I'm expecting to graduate in the Spring of 2022. I did my 
undergrad at the University of Virgina, where I also studied Finance, Information Technology and Classics. I'm extremely interested in Data Analysis, in particular 
Machine Learning, and hope to find a career where I can leverage my interest in data science to glean actionable business insights from massive datasets and act on them.

I've uploaded a few example projects which illustrate my capabilities and background. If you would like to learn more about me, please do not hesitate 
to reach out. Here's my email address: wjsjr@uchicago.edu.

Enjoy!
